## Introduction
Two technical indicators used in trading are the Simple Moving Average (SMA) and the Relative Strength Index (RSI). Trends can be identified with the SMA, while overbought and oversold situations can be detected with the RSI.

## Installation
You have two options: either download the zip file from GitHub and unzip it, or clone the repository to your project.


## Usage
Once the installation is complete, you can launch the program by running the "main.py" file; however, you must change the orcl.csv file with the desired data.
